## Inspired by Swipe Keyboards

EyeSwipe is a proposed fast eye-based user interface for digital devices, initially enabling ALS and other neurologically constrained patients to speak using their eyes much faster than now possible. We plan to make an eye-tracking equivalent of a swipe keyboardâ€“a smartphone app which can be mounted in front of a user's eyes.

## Existing technology

High-precision eye-tracking systems such as Tobii/Dynavox are costly, at $5000-15000, and rarely exceed ~20-25 WPM. EyeSwipe aims to make comfortable 60-80 WPM eye-typing feasible, by applying neural networks trained on videos of eyes typing known phrases.

## The concept

- No visual feedback
- No autocomplete confirmation
- Faster than dwell
